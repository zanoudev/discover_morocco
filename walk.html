            The Moroccan mule, known as "Belgha," has a rich history deeply 
            intertwined with the cultural and economic fabric of Morocco. Originating in the rugged 
            terrains of the Atlas Mountains, the Belgha is a sturdy and surefooted breed of mule that 
            played a crucial role in Morocco's history. Historically, these mules served as indispensable 
            pack animals, carrying goods across challenging mountainous landscapes and connecting 
            remote regions. Their resilience and adaptability made them essential companions for Berber 
            tribes and traders navigating the diverse Moroccan terrain. 
            Beyond their utilitarian role, Belghas became cultural symbols, appearing in local folklore 
            and traditions. Today, while modern transportation has evolved, the legacy of the Moroccan 
            mule endures, and these animals remain emblematic of Morocco's enduring connection to its storied past.
